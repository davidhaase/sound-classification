# Sound Classification
Training a neural network to identify languages based on audio recordings (MP3).  This project is a curriculum requirement of the Flatiron Module 6 project.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The high-level purpose of this project was to build a model that could detect which language was being spoken in a here-to-for unknown audio file.  The model trained on professional language-learning recordings of Arabic, Fârsi, Greek, Russian and Turkish.  And given a snippet of novel audio -- could it determine which language was being spoken.  

The *scholarly* purpose of this project was to introduce ourselves to nueral networks while at the same time discovering if traditional machine-learning techniques can also apply to audio data (MP3s), and if so, what are the "features" that could be used for audio files?

## Project Description
The project had humble beginnings -- can we build a neural network?  If so, can we use audio speech recordings as data? We used professional, high-quality audio recordings for language learning in Arabic, Fârsi, Greek, Russian and Turkish which were split into 2-second exerpts totally 2,808 exercpts.  10% were kept completely apart, and the remaining 90% were used in training and validating the model. We used the librosa package in python to extract 40 MFCC features from the audio to use as our features.  With great surprise, of the 280 novel excerpts, the model successfully identified all but 2 excerpts.
